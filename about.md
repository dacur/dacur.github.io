Hello!  

Thanks for checking out my website - I hope you will find some of the information here useful.

### My story

I'm originally from a small town north of Atlanta, GA.  After high school, I left to study politics at The American University
in Washington, DC. While in Washington, I had the honor of working as a Staff Assistant in the Office of Political
Affairs at the White House.  I also spent two years as a Paralegal working under [Brendan Sullivan, Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Sullivan), 
at [Williams & Connolly, LLP](https://www.wc.com/), and 
spent an election cycle working as an Analyst for a political polling and consulting firm in Arlington, VA.

My other politcal work experience also includes working in Opposition Research for a gubernatorial campaign in GA, as well as
running state House and state Senate campaigns (we lost the latter to future Governor, Sonny Purdue). Later, I spent about two years
living in Augusta, GA, where I took a job working as a Paralegal for the US Department of Justice, in the US Attorney's Office.

From Augusta, I moved to my current home - Raleigh, NC.  I was able to transfer to the US Attorney's Office in Raleigh where I worked on a 
high-profile prosecution of a former US Senator and presidential candidate.  After a few more years of federal service, I landed in my current profession - software
development, which I have been doing since 2014. Earlier this year, I decided to broaden my technical horizons and began studying cybersecurity.  I decided to first pursue
the CompTIA Security+ certification, and then their Cybersecurity Analyst+ certifcation. Today, I am continuing my cybersecurity journey, currently
focusing on learning about cyber threat intelligence.  Thanks for stopping by!

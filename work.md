### Senior Software Engineer

I have been a software developer since 2014. My first role in this world was with a very small agency where I created
mobile and web applications. Because we were so small, developers were tasked with doing almost everything - client comms,
project management, design, architecture, and development. From there, I worked for a larger agency for almost 4 years, focusing
mostly on web application development. By the time I left, I was a Team Lead responsible for a team of four developers.

I'm currently working for an online marketing SaaS company, where I've been since early 2019. Our platform ingests millions
of data points each month, and provides automated advertising for thousands of customers across the US. My work has been mostly 
backend development (Ruby on Rails), but as of late, I have been doing more frontend development (React). Ruby is by far my favorite langauge,
and also the one with which I have the most experience.

### Paralegal Specialist (GS-9), US Department of Justice, US Attorney's Office (Top Secret security clearance)

I spent about four years working for the US Attorney's office, supporting federal prosecutors in a variety of capacities. I provided legal research, wrote
briefings that were filed in federal court, and provided investigative assistance to both prosecutors and our partner state and federal law enforcment officers.

During this time, I spent about a year helping investigate a former US Senator and presidential candidate. Not only was I responsible for managing over 300,000 pages
of documents related to the case, but I also helped develop investigative leads and potential witness lists, as well as helped tracking down witnesses. I acted as the 
USAO's liason between the USAO, FBI, and IRS-CI during the investigation, as well.

### Staff Assistant to the Chief of Staff, Office of Political Affairs, The White House (Secret security clearance)

While living in Washington, DC, I had the honor of working at The White House. My main duty was writing travel and political briefings for the President, Vice President, and 
First Lady. I also acted as a liason between The White House and outside political organizations throughout the US.
